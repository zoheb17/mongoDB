MONGO DB - Quick understanding

What is MongoDB?
A NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents instead of tables.

Why use MongoDB?
Flexible schema (easy changes), fast development, handles large & unstructured data.

When to use?
Web/mobile apps, user profiles, products, chats, logs, social media style data.

When not to use?
Banking heavy transactions, many complex relationships -> better use SQL.

How to use MongoDB (basic idea)
-> Install MongoDB or use MongoDB Atlas (cloud)
-> Define a collection (like table)
-> Insert JSON-like documents
-> Query documents (finds, update, delete)

Example document:
json
{
    "name":"Syed",
    "Age":22,
    "skills":["JS","React"]
}

What is ORM?
-> ORM = Object Relational Mapper
-> Converts database records <-> code objects automatically.
-> Used mostly in SQL database(example: Sequelize, Prisma)

What is Mongoose?
-> Mongoose is not an ORM, it is an ODM
    -> ODM = Object Document Mapper(for MongoDB)
-> It helps:
    . define schema (structure)
    . validate data
    . easy CRUD me6thods
    . avoid writing raw queries

Create MongoDB Account & Get MongoDB URI

Step-by-Step (MongoDB Atlas)
-> Go to: https://www.mongodb.com/atlas
-> Sign in (Google account also works)
-> Create a Project -> Create Cluster (free tier M0)
-> Add Database User -> set username + password
-> Add Network access -> Allow All IPs (0.0.0.0/0)
-> Click Connect -> Connect Your Application
-> Copy the connection string (Mongo URI)

=> mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxx.mongodb.net/myDB

We know JavaScript.
We can code in JavaScript.
We can play with objects/array.

But the data stored in db  is not in js objects or arrays 
In SQL the data is stored in tables.
In NoSQL the data is stored in JSON/BSON.

Either Tables or JSON none of them is in JS to perform in CRUD Operations

To solve this problem we have:
ORM => Object Relational Mapper used for SQL.
which converts table row,col to js objects.

ODM => Object Document Mapper used for NoSQL.
which converts JSON/BSON to js objects. 

For Example : 
In SQL : Get all users
Syntax : SELECT * FROM USERS;

In NoSQL : Get all users 
syntax : Users.findAll()
